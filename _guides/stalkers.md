# Hide and Placate

Stalkers have the highest single-target damage in City of Heroes thanks to
their keystone attack powers Assassin Strike and Assassin's Focus. They rely on
their Hide and Placate abilities for survivability since they're the squishiest
of all melee archetypes. Unfortunately, since every primary and secondary
Stalker powerset requires choosing the same Hide and Placate powers, Stalkers
are left with two fewer power choices than other melee archetypes. Compared to
Scrappers, which share most primary and secondary powersets, they lack area of
effect attacks to deal with large groups of weak enemies.

## Our Changes

We made Hide and Placate inherent powers for Stalkers. That means all Stalkers
start with Hide and Placate without using a power choice.

Converting placate to an inherent allowed it to be replaced for a power in each
powerset that Stalkers were missing compared to Scrappers. Since inherent
powers can't be slotted, Placate's recharge was reduced from 60s to 30s.

* **Street justice:** Rib Cracker
* **Broad Sword:** Whirling Sword
* **Claws:** Spin
* **Dark Melee:** Dark Consumption (balanced as a proper attack, faster
  recharge with lower end restore)
* **Dual Blades:** Typhoon's Edge
* **Electrical Melee:** Lightning Clap
* **Energy Melee:** Whirling Hands
* **Kinetic Melee:** Repulsing Torrent
* **Martial Arts:** Dragon's Tail
* **Ninja Blade:** The Lotus Drops
* **Psiomic Melee:** Psi Blade Sweep
* **Radiation Melee:** Irradiating Aura (a version of Irradiated Ground that
  does not drop a pseudopet, the effects will be on the character instead, this
  power will suppress when hidden.)
* **Savage Melee:** Rending Flurry
* **Spines:** Thorntrops
* **Staff Fighting:** Innocuous Strikes
* **Spectral Melee:** Possess [see new powerset](#New-Stalker-Powersets)

Converting Hide to an inherent power allows Stalker secondary sets to get
mirrors of the Scrapper versions with a few exceptions.

* **Bio Armor:** Evolving Armor
* **Dark Armor:** Umbral fade (PBAoE: Foe Placate, -tohit)
* **Electric Armor:** EMP (PBAoE: Foe Placate, -end)
* **Energy Auara:** Energy Cloak
* **Ice Armor:** Hibernate
* **Invulnerability:** Resist Elements
* **Ninjitsu:** Quick Recovery
* **Radiation Armor:** Beta Decay
* **Regeneration:** Quick Recovery
* **Spectral Aura:** Quick Recovery [see new powerset](#New-Stalker-Powersets)
* **Super Reflexes:** Quick Recovery
* **Willpower:** Quick Recovery

# New Stalker Powersets

A pair of powersets called Spectral Melee and Spectral Aura were added as
Stalker primary and secondary sets respectively. These powersets synergize with
the fear effect from Stalker's Assassin Strike. When a cowering enemy is
attacked with Spectral Melee, it has a chance to spawn spirits that assist in
combat. Spectral Aura causes additional effects on nearby cowering foes.
