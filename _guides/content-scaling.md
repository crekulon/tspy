description: Never outlevel contacts on Thunderspy. All enemy groups scale to
  any level in missions. Enemies in hazard zones ignore level. So, there's always
  something to do!

# Notoriety/Mission Difficulty

Adjustable difficulty in City of Heroes is known as *Notoriety*. Mission
difficulty can be adjusted in terms of number or level of enemies and whether
bosses or archvillains may be encountered. This used to be managed via NPCs
that could be found in most zones.

## Our Changes

Other servers added a menu to adjust notoriety in the easily modified quickchat
menu that's intended for emotes and chat macros so that visiting an NPC isn't
necessary. Thunderspy added a notoriety tab to the mission select menu for a
more polished experience. Additionally, Thunderspy increased the max level
offset to +5 from the vanilla +4 maximum.

# Outleveling Contacts

Contacts issue missions to players. Originally, and on most City of Heroes
servers today, contacts will only talk to players within their level range. If
players exceed the contact's level range, they are forever locked from those
story arcs on that character. Later in the game's life, leveling became faster
and easier, which exacerbated the problem. Players were faced with disabling XP
gain or missing out on content.

## Our Changes

**You can no longer outlevel contacts on Thunderspy**. Contacts still have a
minimum level requirement, but no maximum. All enemy groups have been modified
to scale to any level in missions. Additionally, **enemies in Hazard zones
ignore level**. So there's always something to do!
