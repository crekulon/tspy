Want to help us refine our guides and site content more? It's really easy!

We're using a certain kind of content management system that lets anyone with a GitHub account into the back-end. Any changes you make have to be approved by an admin to actually reach the live site, but you're able to add or edit pretty much anything on the site. The admin panel it takes care of everything for you - you don't even need to know HTML or code! It even has a friendly writing interface.

[So if you've got a change you want to make or something you want to add, even if it's just a screenshot or video on the homepage, hop in and give it a shot!](/admin)

Once you've saved your addition and you think it's ready to run by the mods, be sure you mark its status as "In Review".

*P.S. every form of content has French/Spanish/Japanese inputs, but they are not required. Anything that gets published to the site will end up getting translated in time. If you happen to write those languages fluently, it wouldn't hurt to [help us out with localization too](/guides/website-localization)!*
