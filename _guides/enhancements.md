# History of Enhancements

Enhancements in City of Heroes are like equipment in other MMORPGs: they drop
from defeating enemies, and can be slotted and unslotted to improve a
character's stats much like equipping and unequipping weapons or armor in other
MMOs. They came in three tiers: Training Origin enhancements (TO), the weakest
and usable by anyone; Dual Origin enhancements (DO), intermediary in power and
usable by a character with an origin that matches one of two origins; and
Single Origin enhancements (SO), which were specific to a hero's origin, but
had the highest bonuses. Acquiring these basic enhancements was never a
challenge since they dropped fairly commonly. The real challenge was
maintaining their effectiveness.

TOs, DOs, and SOs degrade in effectiveness every level and eventually expire,
but they can be maintained through combining them up to three times before they
must be replaced. Combining also has a random chance of failing, with higher
failure rates if the enhancements were for a lower level than the hero. If this
sounds tedious, it became worse when leveling became faster later in the game's
life, which required frequent combining and re-slotting. So, although City of
Heroes did not have an equipment grind like other MMORPGs, the trade-off was
spending more time staring at the enhancement menu.

Enter Invention Origin enhancements (IO). As the name implies, IOs were crafted
(invented) using salvage that was also introduced to the enhancement system.
IOs did not expire and their effectiveness greatly overshadowed the original
origin enhancements. Instead of expiring based on level, IOs had a fixed
effectiveness at each level, becoming more effective than SOs at level 26. Many
players would rush to level 26 without enhancements and grind for IOs.

# Our Changes

We overhauled the enhancement system in order to improve the leveling and
gearing up experience. Rather than replacing your enhancements every three
levels or getting Invention Origin enhancements ASAP, the base TO/DO/SOs have
been buffed and no longer expire! Now IOs are still worth slotting, but these
buffs make the early game less of a slog and revives the usefulness of the
original enhancement system.

* **Training Origin** enhancements have been buffed to enhance by **15%**, and
  **can be slotted at any level**.
* **Dual Origin** enhancements have been buffed to enhance by **25%**, and can
  **be slotted at any level after 12**.
* **Single Origin** enhancements have been buffed to enhance by 35%, and **can
  be slotted at any level above 27**.

Since we buffed enhancements to be more effective than they were even when
combined, they can no longer be combined. Consider them to be automatically
combined so that you can spend less time looking at the enhancements menu.

With the new system, the displayed level on the enhancement icons now
represents the minimum level that they can be slotted on. Although, they may
actuall be slotted 3 levels lower due to legacy expectations with veteran
players who are used to slotting +3 combined enhancements.

# Additional Enhancement Slots

You have an additonal 4 total enhancement slots available to distribute, for a
total of 71 (over the vanilla 67)
