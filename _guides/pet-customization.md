description: What was missing from the MMO with the best character
  customization ever? Customizing pets! Now you can customize your pets to look
  like Oompa Loompas, the X-Men, or whatever you can imagine. All pets can be
  customized - even vanity pets.
---

Any pet can be customized on Thunderspy - Mastermind minions,
Controller/Dominator pets, and vanity pets. Certain non-humanoid pets will be
missing animations, but anything that uses the human skeleton will work
perfectly.

1. Rename the pet to anything you want
2. Right-click the pet and select **Edit Costume**
3. Make a really cool costume
4. Hit the **Next** button
5. You're all set!

**WARNING:** Save your pet costume in the editor. You can't get it back otherwise.
