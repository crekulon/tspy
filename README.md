# Thunderspy Gaming Website
This is a Jekyll site that uses Netlify in order to make collaboration on site content easier.
Since it uses Netlify's "Open Authoring", you don't need direct access to the repo or knowledge of how to code/use Github in order to author guides, help with localizations, or anything else handled by Jekyll.
You can reach the open authoring page by going to /admin.

# Local Development
If you're unfamiliar with Jekyll and want to help add new pages/collections/css/etc, [you'll need to install Jekyll and its prerequisites](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements)
Then you can just [follow their guide for how to run it locally](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
Nothing special is needed for Netlify since it's handled wholly within itself and the netlify app we have linked to the site!
