Congratulations to Scaryachi for winning the Thunderspy Halloween costume contest 2022 and a $100 Steam gift card. It was hard to choose a winner since there were a lot of cool costumes that made great use of our custom parts and extended sliders.

Special mention for the haunted doll that was made by one of the Thunderspy staff.
