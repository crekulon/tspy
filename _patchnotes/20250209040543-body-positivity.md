# Asymmetric Tights

W﻿e've added a few asymmetric patterns for chest and leg tights. To accomplish this, we had to mirror every leg and chest texture and every [UV map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping) available to players. It was a lot of effort to add a few patterns to demo this capability, but we'll add more in future updates. You shouldn't notice any difference in the other textures, so let us know if you do!

# F﻿at Guts and Flat Chests

D﻿ad bods are coming to City of Heroes on the Thunderspy server. Not all heroes have washboard abs, so we've added a new torso options for males for more character diversity. Now you can finally make your homage to Mr. Incredible. We've also added flat chests for females.

# Head Details

W﻿e've added three new crowns for all body types.

* O﻿verlord
* M﻿ystic
* I﻿ce King

W﻿e also added a bite mask (human muzzle) like the one Hannibal Lecter wears in Silence of The Lambs.

# L﻿egally Distinct Space Soldiers

T﻿hanks to YouTuber [Controlled Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/@ControlledChaosGaming) for some costume parts that totally aren't inspired by Warhammer 40k Space Marines. He made some shoulders, rifles, and pistols that totally aren't bolters!

#﻿ Unlockable Parts

S﻿ybil's gown can be unlocked for players by earning the Knows No Fear badge. Unlocking it on one character unlocks it for the whole account.

#﻿ Etc

L﻿ast but not least, we added a "Seven Spirit Sword" that kinda looks like a cactus.
