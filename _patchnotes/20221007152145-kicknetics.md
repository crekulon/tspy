# Backend
* Massive rewrites to move to cross-platform support
* Various code improvements for speed and crash fixes

# Server
* Fixed age old bug causing you to get back to back newspaper missions with the same task
* Fixed long-standing issue with custom pet sequencers that was spamming our error log
    - Due to the original bug, custom pets only played Male animations. You should now see appropriate animations according to costume gender.

# Client
## General
* Optimized several parts of renderpath using a Cryptic optimization that had a Paragon TODO on it after fixing the bug preventing the optimization from being used
* Changed a server-only SSE3 optimization to be available for the client as well in 32-bit, since it's not 2004
* Moved PhysX to its own thread
    - This fixes up some issues with things like the timestep where you would see leaves and such seem to hang in the air or drift very slowly downward. Now they move at a natural speed.
* Fixed an entity visibility check for entities within the same tray (room) as you, as the original logic was broken
  - This check is currently set to only turn on during mission maps, as it causes some slowdown in the larger overworld
* Fixed crash when loading power customizations
## Audio
* Added new toggle for "Disable FX Audio Stacking" in the Sound settings
    - This makes things like AoE hits not have increasing volume based on the number of targets hit
## UI
* Added a distance indicator to target UI that shows the distance from an NPC
## Occlusion
* Previous patch did not actually deploy the occlusion changes. This patch contains prior occlusion changes plus new ones.

## General
