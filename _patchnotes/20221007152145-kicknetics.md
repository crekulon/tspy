# Backend

* Massive rewrites to move to cross-platform support
* Various code improvements for speed and crash fixes

# Server

* Fixed age old bug causing you to get back to back newspaper missions with the same task
* Fixed long-standing issue with custom pet sequencers that was spamming our error log

  * Due to the original bug, custom pets only played Male animations. You should now see appropriate animations according to costume gender.

# Client

## General

* Optimized several parts of renderpath using a Cryptic optimization that had a Paragon TODO on it after fixing the bug preventing the optimization from being used
* Changed a server-only SSE3 optimization to be available for the client as well in 32-bit, since it's not 2004
* Moved PhysX to its own thread

  * This fixes up some issues with things like the timestep where you would see leaves and such seem to hang in the air or drift very slowly downward. Now they move at a natural speed.
* Fixed an entity visibility check for entities within the same tray (room) as you, as the original logic was broken

  * This check is currently set to only turn on during mission maps, as it causes some slowdown in the larger overworld
* Fixed crash when loading power customizations

## Audio

* Added new toggle for "Disable FX Audio Stacking" in the Sound settings

  * This makes things like AoE hits not have increasing volume based on the number of targets hit

## UI

* Added a distance indicator to target UI that shows the distance from an NPC

## Occlusion

* Previous patch did not actually deploy the occlusion changes. This patch contains prior occlusion changes plus new ones.

# Base and Apartments

* Store NPCs are now functional

# Apartments

* Storage tables are now functional

# Mobs:

## General

* Croatoa Ghosts fixed expanded level range up to 54 for content scaling
* Sniper class enemies increased from 50% To-Hit to 65% To-Hit

## AI

* Enemies now treat damage to their allies as part of their aggro, rather than just the damage they receive.

## Pets

* Pets have a near unlimited aggro cap, so they won't stand around in high aggro scenarios

# Powers

* Intangiblity added to Singularity, Water Golem, and Vortex

## Pools

### Medicine

* Aid Self

  * Activation time increased from 2.33 -> 3.33

## Gravity Control

* Singularity attack range reduced to 40ft to improve pet responsiveness

## Kinetics

* Fix issue believed to be behind error log spam and crashes
* "Kicknetics" customization now added to Forceful Blow and Energetic Strike
* Impulse

  * Added 5% (scales with AT modifiers) damage bonus per stack
  * All attacks that consumed impulse now only consume at 5 stacks
  * All attacks now generate impulse at under 5 stacks
* Coalescence

  * Damage bonus converted from +40% to +40% as energy damage (this bonus energy damage does not scale with damage bonuses)
* Speed Siphon

  * Removed Knock down
* Repel

  * Knockback chance against players reduced from 100% -> 27%

## Sonic Resonance

* Disruption Field

  * Knockback chance increased to 100%

## Force Field

* Repulsion Field

  * End cost reduced from 0.39 -> -0.195
  * Activation rate increased from 1s -> 0.5s
  * Radius increased from 9 -> 10
  * Max targets increased from 10 -> 16
  * Knockback is now guarenteed

## Broadsword

* Whirling Sword

  * Changed to not do DoT on Fiery Embrace and instead front load the damage
  * Increase Lethal DoT damage to match Katana which was slightly higher (0.1/tick -> 0.12/tick)

## Katana

* The Lotus Drops

  * Changed to not do DoT on Fiery Embrace and instead front load the damage

## Patron Pools

* Mace Mastery (Black Scorpion)

  * Reduced Scorpion Shield from 15% Smash/Lethal Defense to 10% Smash/Lethal Defense across all applicable ATs, matching the Energy Defense provided.

## VEATs

* Placate is now instant activation

## Defender

* Vigilance no longer has a cast time

## Inspirations

* Holiday inspirations have been fixed to be Team Inspirations instead of a stacked buff on you per ally nearby. This was a bug caused by the original devs.

# Costumes

## Arachnos Soldier

* All unlockable Assault Rifles are now usable in the Arachnos Assault Rifle customizations

# Maps

## The Hollows

* Fixed a Skulls NPC that was supposed to have his arms crossed causing error logging.
* Fixed Vahzilok ambushes not properly playing the Zombie Resurrect animation, because a Paragon dev couldn't use spellcheck.

## Nerva Archipelago

* Fixed Crey Researcher spawns to properly let them investigate their pile of bones

# Invention

* All SG base recipes use materials instead of salvage
* Empowerment station recipes use materials instead of salvage
* Fixed Backup Radio recipe using Luck Charm instead of Magic Trinket
* Fixed Theft of Essence recipe using Spell Scroll instead of Magic Trinket
