All new modeled and textured parts under backpacks called Mutant Spines and Mutant Spikes.

# Inherent Powers

  * Domination
    - No longer has a cast time, activates instantly

# Pain Domination

  Pain Domination numbers were tuned and designed around MMs first so the corruptor self buff numbers ended up somewhat crazy and this is being dialed back, MMs are still not quite where i'd like them to be so they're getting a self damage buff increase. (the lower MM personal damage modifer is so low that it can be very high without impacting balance very much if at all.)

    - Now ticks every 1s instead of every 4.25s

## Corruptor

  * Nullify Pain
    - Now caps at three stacks for a maximum 30% damage increase.
