# Pool Power Attack Changes

* Overall changes should result in damage buffs that make pool power attacks strong enough to consider taking while equivilent options remain competative with eachother.

* All Pool Power attacks have been reviewed and adjusted to follow damage formulas, for the most part these are buffs across the board but a few are being nerfed (utility belts cone was kinda nutty)

* Single target attacks in origin power pools (Sorcery, Gadgetry, Force of Will, Utility Belt, Experimentation.) have been set to 8s recharge and scale 1.64 damage. any that had DoT effects have had their DoTs sped up to do the same total damage in half the time.

## Fighting Power Pool

    * Boxing
        - Rebalanced recharge scale from 2.5s to 6s (60%~ damage/end cost increase)
    * Kick
        - Reblanced recharge scale from 3 to 10s (70%~ damage/end increase)

## Flight

    * Air Superiority
        - Rebalanced recharge scale from 4s to 8s (60%~ damage/end cost increase)

## Jumping

    * Jump Kick
        - Rebalanced recharge scale from 2.8s to 8s (63%~ damage/end cost increase)

## Melee Class Ranged Modifiers
