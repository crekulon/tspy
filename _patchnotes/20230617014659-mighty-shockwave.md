# Invention Enhancements

  * All proc effects and unique IOs are now disabled in PvP
  * All versions of the lockdown chance for +2 hold proc are now percentage based instead of proc per minute (this was one of the most busted IOs due to how if it was slotted into a power with over 10s recharge it had a 90% chance to proc)
