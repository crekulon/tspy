# Rapid Brawl
# Rapid Brawl

We removed the cooldown from Brawl, so you can give enemies the ol' one-two as fast as the activation time permits. New characters who lack other attacks will have something to do with their fists while they wait for their powers to cool down.

We've also enabled by default the procs that the Fighting pool used to unlock on Brawl.

# The Horny Costume Pack

Not that kind of horny. We've added 16 all new custom modeled and textured horn costume parts for Detail 1 and Detail 2 on all genders.

* 6 antlers
* 3 ibex horns
* 2 oni horns
* 2 dragon horns
* 3 tusks

# The Polish

* Enabled all costume parts that are unobtainable in-game without Paragon Reward tokens or Super Packs 
* Removed all non-repeatable options from the Paragon loyalty tree
* Removed all costume parts from Super Packs
* Removed enhancement unslotters from Super Packs
* Moved some prestige powers to the Merit Vendor
    * Rocket Board
    * Magic Carpet
    * Void Skiff
    * Sands of Mu
    * Nemesis Staff
    * Black Wand
    * Ghost Slaying Axe
    * All NPC disguise powers
    * All vanity pets
* Made some powers inherent
    * Inner Inspiration
    * Return to Battle
    * Mission Teleporter
    * Pocket D VIP Pass
    * Self-destruct
* All inherent teleports and vendor travel powers require level 6
* Deleted all other prestige powers not previously mentioned
* Granted all new characters 6 respecs and 10 free tailor tokens automatically without claiming them from emails
* Set default inf cap to VIP inf cap
* Removed all VIP or veteran requirements to earn Vanguard or Incarnate rewards
* Removed VIP or veteran requirements for all powersets and archetypes

The point of these changes is to improve the onboarding experience for new players by removing the requirement to "purchase" all the premium content. It also clears the power tray of clutter on new characters or after respecs.

# Boring Stuff

* Removed the taunt aura from Knights minions
