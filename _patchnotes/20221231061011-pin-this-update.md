title: PIN THIS UPDATE!
icon: /img/qachan.png
description: The main highlight of this update is mobs in hazard zones ignore
  level scaling (endless street sweeping). Mayhem missions can be chosen instead
  of random. Thumbtack system allows sharing map coordinates with other players.
  More!

# Hazard Zones

* Implemented mob scaling for the following zones: Sewer Network, Abandoned Sewer Network, Perez Park, The Hollows, The Tunnels, Boomtown, Striga Island, Crey's Folly, Terra Volta, Eden, and all Shadow Shard maps

# Brokers

* Rewrote contact support to add the ability to select the Mayhem/Safeguard from a Broker/Detective's selection, rather than being at the mercy of RNG

# Ouroboros

* Fixed mission visibility in Ouroboros for sub-50 players
* Changed Max's missions to properly show up in the level 50 pool instead of 1-15

# Story Arcs

* IVy
  - Fixed bugged, dead citizen spawns in IVy's first mission caused by an OG developer having values swapped in their spreadsheet
* Warrant
  - Changed Save Syfotine Industries from `P_Tech_45` layouts to `P_Tech_60` in order to workaround an lack of enough encounters on one of the map layouts

# Thumbtack System

* Added support for setting thumbtack location with /thumbtack <x> <y> <z>
* Added support for sending thumbtacks with chat links using [Pos: <x> <y> <z>] 
* Added support for $loc which will send a chat link based off the entity, similar to $target, etc..
* /loc and /whereami now both provide a chat link to you for a thumbtack when outputting your position

# Apartments

* Fixed remaining checks, so that account-wide storage now works
* Disabled code related to SG Texture Swaps (for logos), which should prevent some old crashes
* Made force save occur when `base_default_sky` is run
* Added new `base_outdoor_lights 0\1` command - Currently, it only turns on shadows until I address object lighting.

# Powers

* Made granted powers not interrupt
* Restraint
  - Fixed Restraint damage reduction durations to properly stay on

## Widow - Tarantula

  * Fix Venom Bolt and Venom Burst using incorrect Attack Types, leading to the defense roll being against Energy damage. This was also the source of a map crash when our aggressive error detection was enabled.

## Inspirations

* Removed 5% increase loyalty bonus in non-PvP zones
* Swapped Purple's (Defense) values with Orange's (Resistance) values
  - New values: 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%
* Change Orange's (Resistance) values to 2x it's original value then reduced by 15%
  - New values: 17%, 25.5%, 34%, 51%
* Added End Drain Resistance to Orange with the same values as the other Resistances

# Patrons
* Fixed Scrapper/Stalker Mace Summon to be 480 second recharge instead of 48
* Fixed VEAT summons (except Mace, which was already correct) to be 480 seconds instead of 600

# Client

* Fix B and R colors being swapped on certain DXT textures during decoding, such as billboards in Mercy Island
* Fix buffs not showing on status bar
* Removed automatic AFK logoff
* Rewrite Zowie (glowie) code to address an OG dev TODO
* Fixed a crash caused by chat bubbles
* Rewrite shadow visibility test to an improved one that causes less indoor shadowing issues while maintaining roughly the same draw call reduction as before
* Fixed flickering mobs in the Baby New Year's mission and possibly other maps and may address glowies being hidden.
* Cleanup of various code in the effort to adjust the codebase for C-over-C++ for more important future work. This is an on-going effort (~27,000 errors to fix originally). In theory, some of the changes will speedup some code. In other cases, it has removed duplicate, unnecessary code.
  - Addressed possible bug with Power Tray code that could cause an out-of-bounds read
  - Changed sorting algorithm usage across the board to one we were previously using for specific cases

# Backend

* Enable crash dumps in Release builds
  - Currently disabled on client
* Fix Supergroup badge lookup
  - Fixes search UI crash in Apartments
* Fix a crash that can occur on extremely large apartment designs
  - Note: This may still occur for some scenarios. If you experience this, send me your SG name or a character on your account.
* Fix crash caused by contacts, such as Breakout, as well as issue with contact requiring relog to speak with you
* Fix an OG bug where having more than 2 IssueOnEnter contacts in a zone would fail to add the additional ones
* Fix cause of duplicate IssueOnEnter type contacts
* Add check that will remove any duplicate IssueOnEnter contacts with no missions done for them to prevent loss of storyarc progress
  - Note: Duplicates will not be removed until you enter the zone where they are issued.
* Fix intermittent collision issue seen with MM pets and other entities, such as Pocket D jump pads
* Fix crash that can occur in non-mission maps due to pointer truncation that was missed in 64-bit upgrade
