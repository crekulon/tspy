## Weapons (Titan Weapons, Dual Blades, Swords, Maces, and Axes)

  * Added a "Type 1" function that allows for better catagorizing and effincient organization when dealing with the same weapons that use different textures. For instance, Kanabo Wood and Kanabo Metal would normally be two separate options. Under Type 1 they would be one option with a sub-option that lets you choose which texture you want. This also works with model adjustments as well and opens the door for anyone to start making textures and model adjustment options that we could add into the game in the future. This will eventually get added to everything as we start to utilize them more. Please let me know if there are any discrepancies or errors in these catagories.

## Assault Rifle

  * Fixed female placement of the F2000
