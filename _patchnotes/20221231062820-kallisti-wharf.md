description: Kallisti Wharf is coming home (to the Thunderspy Server)!
  Accessible via Ferry, Tram, or TUNNEL, our version of Kallisti Wharf is alive
  with with Crey, Nemesis, Longbow, PPD, and Arachnos spawns, and an Arachnos
  flyer for Heroes to get their badge without doing MLTF. PPD, Longbow, and
  Arachnos are Yellow con (as in attackable by Heroes and Villains, but not
  aggressive). Be the Rogue or Vigilante you always wanted to be! The sewers of
  Paragon City and Boomtown are now also accessible to villains via Kallisti.
